1). List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query.

	Hive 			: Time taken: 50.33 seconds, Fetched: 50 row(s)
	SparkSQL		: Time taken: 11.067 seconds, Fetched 50 row(s)
	SparkSQL on Parquet	: Time taken: 2.882 seconds, Fetched 50 row(s)



2). How many jobs does Hive launch> Does SparkSQL launch jobs?

	Hive : 	Query ID = w205_20160926172626_52578b16-cfe5-46b2-9d50-68ced52a630d
		Total jobs = 2 <--------- Two jobs launched

	SparkSQL: SparkSQL logs do not show that it is launching any jobs. I verified that log level is set at INFO.

3). Write a quaery which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations

spark-sql> SELECT location, COUNT(location) AS lab_3_locations
         > FROM user_info FULL OUTER JOIN weblogs_parquet
         > GROUP BY location
         > ORDER BY lab_3_locations DESC;
